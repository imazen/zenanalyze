//! Trial-encode strategy + budget for multi-cell picker disambiguation.
//!
//! A K=1 picker's top-1 prediction is free (no encode), but for multi-cell codecs
//! (webp/avif) it can mis-pick a content-underdetermined knob — webp's 5-way `filter`
//! is only ~32% predictable from content, vs ~94% for `method` and ~62% for
//! `sharp_yuv` (held-out, 2026-06-29). A *multi-shot* pass trial-encodes the picker's
//! top-K ranked candidates (which differ only in the ambiguous knob) and keeps the
//! best by the codec's metric — accurate, but it costs extra encodes whose cost scales
//! with image size.
//!
//! Two orthogonal controls:
//! - [`PickerStrategy`] — the codec's *mode*: trust the pick, force trials, or adapt.
//! - [`EncodeBudget`] — a *multi-axis resource ceiling* the **application** sets
//!   (max passes / trial pixels / wall-time ms). The most restrictive binds.
//!
//! The per-encode time estimate is **not** in the budget — the application shouldn't
//! have to guess it. The *codec* owns a cost model, so it passes its own
//! `est_ms_per_encode` into [`EncodeBudget::resolve`] when it resolves the ms axis.
//! [`EncodeBudget::time_exhausted`] is the runtime safety net for when that estimate
//! undershoots: the codec checks its measured clock and stops.
