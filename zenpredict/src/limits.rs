//! Resource limits enforced by the parser.
//!
//! These constants bound the parser's resource use against
//! adversarial input. The numbers are picked to comfortably exceed
//! every realistic shipped bake (V0_18 zensim is 93 KB, the largest
//! shipped picker is the zenavif rav1e v0.1.1 at 217 KB; the deepest
//! shipped layer count is 4) while staying small enough that a
//! gigabyte-claiming header fails fast.
//!
//! ## Hardening pattern
//!
//! Every limit is enforced **before** memory is allocated against
//! the value it bounds. `MAX_BAKE_BYTES` rejects the byte slice
//! itself before the header is read. `MAX_DIM` / `MAX_LAYERS` reject
//! the parsed-but-untrusted header values before the scratch
//! allocation in [`crate::Predictor::new`] tries to materialize them.
//! `MAX_LZ4_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES` (when the `compressed-weights`
//! feature is active) bounds the worst-case scratch buffer for an
//! `I8Lz4` layer.
//!
//! ## Picking numbers
//!
//! 64 MB / 64 K / 256 are 1000x – 10000x larger than any production
//! bake. They're upper bounds that protect web / fuzz / no_std-alloc
//! consumers from runaway parsing without restricting legitimate
//! research / picker work. Adjust if a real bake ever approaches
//! the limit (none should).
